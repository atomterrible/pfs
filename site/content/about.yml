  Experience running church audio and recording weddings, and then I volunteered
  to run sound on a no-budget indie feature in 2011. Had my name passed around
  and have been getting paid to do it ever since.


  I've done international documentary work, reality TV, and narrative film, and I've had my fair share of solo work on micro-budget indie films.
